                    All submitted papers must be original and exclusive to ICRTAC'24.
                    Simultaneous submissions to other journals or conferences are strictly
                    prohibited. To maintain the integrity of the conference, we expect all
                    papers to be based on unpublished original work. By submitting a paper, at
                    least one of the authors must be committed to registering and presenting
                    the paper at the conference.

                    submission, and early registration can be found in the Important Dates
                    section of the conference website. Keeping track of these dates will help

                    Quality and originality are paramount to us. Each submitted paper will
                    undergo a thorough peer review by a minimum of three independent referees
                    who are experts in the field. Additionally, all papers will undergo a

                    form. Furthermore, presenting the accepted paper at the conference is
                    mandatory. This practice fosters an environment of knowledge sharing and
                    scholarly interaction. To maintain the academic integrity of the
                    conference, we employ standard plagiarism detection tools to scrutinize
                    all submissions. Any instance of plagiarism will result in rejection,
                    regardless of the stage of review.
